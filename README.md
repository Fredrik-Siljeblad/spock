-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   For simplicity's sake I chose black text on white background.
    -   #### Typography
        -   As main font I have chosen 'Russo One', with Sans Serif as a fallback font family. 'Russo One' looks a bit like
        the fonts used in the 'Star Trek'.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I found an image on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pierre_ciseaux_feuille_l%C3%A9zard_spock_aligned.svg), that I used as a background image.
